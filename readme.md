# Zig [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) Wrapper

## A pretty interface to use CSFML in a way that looks Object-Oriented in zig!

### What this is

This is a wrapper for CSFML. Theres no problem importing CSFML in Zig, but the resulting code can be a little bit messy.
My goal is to make things close enough to SFML, with nice methods.

This currently for Zig 0.12 (should work with 0.13) and CSFML 2.6.1.

### Adding to your project

Add using Zig's package manager like so: `zig fetch --save https://github.com/Guigui220D/zig-sfml-wrapper/archive/d5272051a937c8a3756bb96eab8276b76a271de4.tar.gz` (replace the commit hash if you want an other version).

Add this to your exe compile in `build.zig`:

```zig
const sfml = @import("sfml"); // AT THE TOP OF THE FILE

exe.root_module.addImport("sfml", b.dependency("sfml", .{}).module("sfml"));
sfml.link(exe);
```

> **Note:** Your project must know the location of the CSFML2.6.1 include, lib, and binaries directories for successful building and running. For more information, please refer to the wiki ðŸ‘‡ 

Check the [wiki](../../wiki) for more details on how to compile your project or the examples.

### Small example

This is a small example of how you use this sfml wrapper:

```zig
//! This is a translation of the c++ code the sfml website gives you to test if SFML works
//! for instance, in this page: https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/start-vc.php

const sf = struct {
    usingnamespace @import("sfml");
    usingnamespace @import("sfml").graphics;
};

pub fn main() !void {
    var window = try sf.RenderWindow.createDefault(.{ .x = 200, .y = 200 }, "SFML works!");
    defer window.destroy();

    var shape = try sf.CircleShape.create(100.0);
    defer shape.destroy();
    shape.setFillColor(sf.Color.Green);

    while (window.isOpen()) {
        while (window.pollEvent()) |event| {
            if (event == .closed)
                window.close();
        }

        window.clear(sf.Color.Black);
        window.draw(shape, null);
        window.display();
    }
}
```

### Projects made with this wrapper

Feel free to add your project to this list!

- [Pong clone I made](https://github.com/Guigui220D/sfml-pong-zig)
- [Minez](https://github.com/Guigui220D/minez) an arcade looking minecraft inspired mining game
- [quran-warsh](https://github.com/muslimDevCommunity/quran-warsh) a desktop quran app
  
### How much is done

Most of the classes are wrapped and you should be able to write games with this wrapper.
The network module is a recent addition and does not contain all classes yet (HTTP, FTP, ...).
Threads are not available yet.
